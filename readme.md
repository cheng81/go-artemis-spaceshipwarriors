# Go [Artemis] - Spaceship warriors #

Port of the Sapceship warriors Artemis example.
It uses the Go port of Artemis, and implements almost everything of the original example - except the HUD and in general text stuff, because that's boring.

The only notable change, is that there is a different particle render system - implemented mostly as an exercise.
